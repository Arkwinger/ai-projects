# Model Weights

The trained model file (`malware_classifier.pth`) is **not included** because GitHub does not allow files over 100 MB.

## How to regenerate the model

Run the training script:


```yaml

This will recreate:

````


## Why weights are not included?

- GitHub upload limit: **100 MB**
- The trained model is ~102 MB
- Standard practice in ML repos is to exclude large weight files
